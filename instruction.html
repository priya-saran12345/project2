         monthly international journal, being published every month by Institute of Technical
          and Scientific Research India.
<br><br>
It is academic, peer reviewed, online, open access (full paper) international journal.
 It aims to publish original, theoretical and practical advances in technical research,
  science and management. All the submitted papers will be reviewed and select by the board of committee of IJTRS.
<br><br>
The aim of the journal is to disseminate original, scientific,
 theoretical or applied research in the field of Engineering and 
 allied fields, to dispense a platform for publishing results and research with a strong 
 empirical component, to aqueduct the significant gap between research and practice by promoting the publication
  of original, novel, industry-relevant research, to seek original and unpublished research papers based on theoretical
   or experimental works for the publication globally, to publish original, theoretical and practical advances in MElectrical
    Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science
     Engineering, Forestry Engineering, Food Engineering, Water Resource Engineering, Biotechnology Engineering, 
     Architecture & Planning, Aerospace Engineering, Bio Mechanical& Biomedical Engineering, Geo Technical Engineering,
      Gas Engineering, Geological Engineering, Production Engineering, Forensic Engineering, Nanotechnology, Environmental
       Science, General Science, Education, Economics, Management, Human Resources & Many More, to impart a platform for
        publishing results and research with a strong empirical component, to create a bridge for significant gap between 
        research and practice by promoting the publication of original, novel, industry-relevant research, to solicit original
         and unpublished research papers, based on theoretical or experimental works.
