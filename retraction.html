                <h2>Article Withdrawal Policy

                </h2> <br>
                <p>International Journal of Technical Research & Science (Published by: Institute of Technical and
                    Scientific Research) is having ISSN 2454-2024 (online), monthly international journal, being
                    published every month by Institute of Technical and Scientific Research India.

<br>                    IJTRS recognizes the importance of the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record to
                    researchers and librarians and attaches the highest importance to maintaining trust in the authority
                    of its electronic archive.

                <h2>IJTRS Policy </h2><br>
                <p>
                    It is a general principle of scholarly communication that the editor of a learned journal is solely
                    and independently responsible for deciding which articles submitted to the journal shall be
                    published. In making this decision the editor is guided by policies of the journal’s editorial board
                    and constrained by such legal requirements in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and
                    plagiarism. An outcome of this principle is the importance of the scholarly archive as a permanent,
                    historic record of the transactions of scholarship. Articles that have been published shall remain
                    extant, exact and unaltered as far as is possible. However, very occasionally circumstances may
                    arise where an article is published that must later be retracted or even removed. Such actions must
                    not be undertaken lightly and can only occur under exceptional circumstances.


                </p>
                <h2>Article withdrawal

                </h2><br>
                <p>Commonly used for Articles in Press which when early versions of articles are withdrawn due to
                    errors. Sometimes accidentally submitted twice or to multiple journals that represent infringements
                    of professional ethical codes, plagiarism and fraudulent use of the data may be “Withdrawn” from
                    IJTRS. Withdrawn means that the article content (HTML and PDF) is removed and replaced with an HTML
                    page/ PDF stating that the article has been withdrawn according to the IJTRS Policy.

                </p>
                <h2>Article Retraction

                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>Commonly used for post-publishing methods, dealing with infringements of editorial ethical codes,
                    fraudulent use of data, plagiarism and other issues related to the publication section. In most of
                    the cases, a retraction of an article by its authors or editor under the advice of members of the
                    scholarly community of the learned world will be used in order to correct such errors as the ones
                    stated above.

                </p>

                <h2>Article removal: legal limitations

                </h2>

                <br>
                <p>Sometimes, it may be necessary to completely remove an article from the online database. May occur in
                    an extremely limited number of cases when an article is clearly defamatory, or infringes others’
                    legal rights, the subject of a court order, or article might pose a serious health risk.

                </p>
                <h2>Article replacement

                </h2><br>
                <p>
                    In cases where the article, if acted upon, might pose a serious health risk, the authors of the
                    original article may wish to retract the flawed original and replace it with a corrected version. In
                    these circumstances the procedures for retraction will be followed with the difference that the
                    database retraction notice will publish a link to the corrected re-published article and a history
                    of the document.
